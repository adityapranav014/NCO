            <h2>Networking and Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Networking is the practice of connecting computers, devices, and systems so they can share data and
                resources. Communication protocols are rules that govern how data is exchanged between devices.
                Understanding networking concepts is important for troubleshooting, managing networks, and connecting to
                the
                internet.

            <h3>Why Understanding Hardware and Software is Important?</h3>
            <p>
                Understanding the difference between hardware and software is important because:
            <ul>
                <li>It helps troubleshoot and repair computers by understanding how the components work together.</li>
                <li>It allows you to choose the right hardware and software for specific needs (gaming, business,
                    education,
                    etc.).</li>
                <li>It provides a foundation for learning more advanced computer science topics, such as programming,
                    networking, and data storage.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>How Software Works with Hardware</h3>
            <p>
                The operating system (software) manages hardware resources (like RAM, CPU, and storage) to ensure that
                applications (like a web browser or word processor) can run. The CPU processes instructions, RAM stores
                active data, and storage devices save files permanently.
            </p>

            <h3>Common Examples of Hardware and Software</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware Example:</strong> A gaming PC with a high-performance CPU (Intel i9) and 16 GB of
                    RAM
                    is ideal for playing advanced video games.</li>
                <li><strong>Software Example:</strong> Adobe Photoshop is an application that allows users to edit
                    images.
                    It works by using the computer's hardware resources to run complex operations on images, such as
                    resizing and applying filters.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Practical Example</h3>
            <div class="examples">
                <p>
                    <strong>Example 1:</strong> When you open a program like Microsoft Word, the operating system loads
                    the
                    software into RAM so that it can run quickly. The CPU handles all the calculations needed to edit
                    the
                    document.<br>
                    <strong>Example 2:</strong> If you save a document, the operating system writes the file to your
                    hard
                    drive (HDD or SSD), ensuring it is stored safely for later use.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong> creates the structure of the webpage (headings, paragraphs, links, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>CSS</strong> styles the webpage, controlling how elements are displayed, such as colors,
                    sizes,
                    and layouts.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> adds interactivity and dynamic content, such as animations, popups, and
                    forms.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Basic Example of a Web Page</h3>

            <h3>Control Structures</h3>
            <p>
                Control structures allow the program to make decisions (conditionals) or repeat actions (loops).
            </p>

            <h4>Conditionals</h4>
            <p>
                Conditionals allow a program to choose between two or more paths based on conditions. The most common
                conditional statement is the <strong>if</strong> statement.
            </p>
            <pre>
            if (condition) {
                // code to execute if condition is true
            } else {
                // code to execute if condition is false
            }
        </pre>
            <p>
                <strong>Example in JavaScript:</strong>
            <pre>
                let age = 15;
                if (age >= 18) {
                    console.log("You are an adult.");
                } else {
                    console.log("You are a minor.");
                }
            </pre>
            </p>

            <h4>Loops</h4>
            <p>
                Loops allow a program to execute a block of code multiple times.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Loop:</strong> Repeats a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
                <pre>
                for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    console.log(i);
                }
            </pre>
                <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> Repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true.</li>
                <pre>
                let i = 0;
                while (i < 5) {
                    console.log(i);
                    i++;
                }
            </pre>
            </ul>

            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <p>
                A function is a block of code that can be called to perform a specific task. Functions can accept input
                (parameters) and return output (return values).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Function Declaration:</strong>
                    <pre>
                    function greet(name) {
                        return "Hello, " + name;
                    }
                </pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Function Call:</strong>
                    <pre>
                    let message = greet("Ayaan");
                    console.log(message); // Output: "Hello, Ayaan"
                </pre>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Programming Example</h3>
            <p>
                The following example demonstrates how variables, operators, control structures, and functions work
                together
                in a simple program:
            </p>
            <pre>
            function checkAge(age) {
                if (age >= 18) {
                    return "Adult";
                } else {
                    return "Minor";
                }
            }
    
            let age = 20;
            console.log(checkAge(age));
            // Output: "Adult"  
        </pre>

            <h3>Best Practices for Programming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Write clear and meaningful variable names.</li>
                <li>Always comment your code to explain complex logic.</li>
                <li>Test your code frequently to catch errors early.</li>
                <li>Keep your code simple and organized.</li>
            </ul>
